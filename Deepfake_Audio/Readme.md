## ðŸ§  AI-Generated Audio

As part of the MNW Benchmark, the NSAIL lab at Northwestern University generated **40,000 synthetic audio clips** across **40 audio generation methods** spanning 2017â€“2025.

Each method produced **250 samples**, synthesized from transcripts in the [VCTK corpus](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2651), a benchmark dataset in voice synthesis. When available, official voice identities from each toolkit were used; otherwise, a reference voice was randomly chosen from our curated set of 206 deceased individuals (\$DI\$). 

### ðŸŽ› Perturbations

Each clean sample was augmented with 3 variants:

1. **Additive Gaussian noise**
2. **Environmental noise** (from [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50))
3. **Time-stretching** 

These simulate malicious modifications used to evade detection models.
